# Developing games with C/C++

This repository contains source code from basic to advanced games mostly focusing 
on data structures and algorithms. <br/> Anybody is free to contribute (either by 
supplying more ideas, coming up with completely new ideas or algorithms of their own). 
The basic idea behind 'cpp_games' is to show how algorithms and data structures play 
a very important part (or role) in game development.
